# ESOC-Replication

This repository contains exercise solutions and replication codes of some graphs for the articles assigned in the Princeton Empirical Studies of Conflict (ESOC) lab - Pre Doctoral Program. Please kindly note that I am not affiliated with the program and that these codes are being used solely for educational purposes to advance my coding and quantitative data skills. Additionally, you can also check out the original repository on your own via [this link](https://github.com/esoclabprinceton/ESOC-Predoc-Training).
