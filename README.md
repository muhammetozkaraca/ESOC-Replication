# ESOC-Replication

This repository includes solutions and replication codes for some graphs in the articles for the Princeton Empirical Studies of Conflict (ESOC) lab - Pre Doctoral Program. Please kindly note, I am not affiliated with the program and these codes are only for educational purposes to advance my coding and quantitative data skills. You can also check the original repository on your own via [this link](https://github.com/esoclabprinceton/ESOC-Predoc-Training).
